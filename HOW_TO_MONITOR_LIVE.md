# How to Monitor Live Paper Trading

## Setup: Two Terminal Windows

### Terminal 1: Run Paper Trading
This terminal runs the actual paper trading system:

```bash
python run_paper_trading.py
```

This will:
- Monitor all active NBA games
- Fetch Kalshi prices every 60 seconds
- Fetch NBA play-by-play data
- Generate ML trading signals
- Execute paper trades (simulated)
- Log everything to PostgreSQL database

### Terminal 2: Live Dashboard
This terminal shows you what's happening in real-time:

```bash
python live_dashboard.py
```

This will show:
- **Session Stats**: Total trades, wins/losses, win rate, total P/L
- **Open Positions**: All currently open trades (when model says BUY)
- **Recent Trades**: Last 5 closed trades (when model says SELL)
- **Recent Signals**: All signals generated by the ML model
- **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 5 seconds

## What You'll See

### Open Positions
Shows trades that are currently active:
- **Entry Price**: Price when the model said to BUY
- **Contracts**: Number of contracts (based on model confidence)
- **Time**: How long ago the position was opened
- **Reason**: Why the model entered (e.g., "High probability buy signal")

### Recent Trades (Closed)
Shows completed trades:
- **Entry/Exit Price**: Buy and sell prices
- **P/L**: Profit/Loss in dollars (GREEN = profit, RED = loss)
- **Duration**: How long the position was held
- **Exit Reason**: Why the model sold (e.g., "Stop loss hit", "Take profit", "Time-based exit")

### Recent Signals
Shows all signals generated:
- **BUY**: Model wants to enter a trade
- **SELL**: Model wants to exit an open position
- **HOLD**: No action needed
- **Probability**: Model confidence (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Reason**: Why this signal was generated

## Alternative: View Database Directly

You can also query the database at any time:

```bash
python view_paper_trading.py
```

This gives you a complete historical view of all sessions, trades, and performance.

## Tips

1. **Wait for games to start**: The system won't generate signals until games are actually in progress

2. **Watch for BUY signals**: When you see a green "BUY" signal in Recent Signals, check Open Positions to see if a trade was opened

3. **Watch for SELL signals**: When you see a red "SELL" signal, that position will close and move to Recent Trades

4. **Monitor P/L**: The dashboard shows real-time profit/loss for the session

5. **Multiple games**: The system monitors all active games simultaneously - you'll see trades across different games

## Stopping Paper Trading

Press `Ctrl+C` in the paper trading terminal to stop cleanly. The session will be marked as ended in the database.
